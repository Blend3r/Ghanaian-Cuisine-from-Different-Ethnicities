### How Geography Affects the Different Types of Food Available

Geography affects the types of food available in several ways, such as:

* In some places, the terrain is higher, and less water flows, but in others, the terrain is low, and more water flows.
* Agriculture and fishing are used in the southern regions of Ghana, therefore affecting the ingredients.

### Differences between food in Northern Ghana and Southern Ghana
In the Southern region, they eat a lot of corn and plant-based foods, as well as fish, and plant-based _soups_, sometimes made with meat. However, the Northern region is known for its trade with other countries. They also make food _mostly_ without fish, and they use other types of meat instead.
