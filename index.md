### How Geography Affects the Different Types of Food Available

Geography affects the types of food available in several ways, such as:

* In some places, the terrain is higher, and less water flows, but in others, the terrain is low, and more water flows.
* Agriculture and fishing are used in the southern regions of Ghana, therefore affecting the ingredients.
